## GUI for lasertanks

##authored by urs truely slickpockets

done:
  - settings page
    - tabed area to switch between the settings, checkboxes for powerups (maybe switch to multi select),
  - main page
    - only a snigle health bar for testing
  - mqtt > socketio > page completeness
    - messages published through mosquitto_pub get processed by backend,and  published ot page (testing)
 
todo:
  - updating health bar is currently in testing phase, and even then isnt behaving as expected.
  - create callbacks for all expected mqtt topics and messages
  - glue mqtt to socketio as needed
